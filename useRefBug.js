This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the effect cleanup function has a chance to run.  This can happen when navigating away from a screen quickly or when the component is updated rapidly. The cleanup function in `useEffect` is crucial for canceling any timers, subscriptions, or other resources that may still be in use, preventing memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
